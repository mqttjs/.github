## Welcome to the MQTT.js Organization

### About Us

MQTT.js is a community-driven organization focused on developing and maintaining open-source projects related to MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for the JavaScript ecosystem. MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time communication applications.

Our mission is to provide high-quality MQTT tools, libraries, and resources to help developers build robust and scalable MQTT-based applications.

### Main Projects

Explore our collection of MQTT-related projects:

#### 1. [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js)

MQTT.js is a widely-used MQTT client library for JavaScript, designed to run in both browser and Node.js environments. It provides a simple and reliable way to connect to MQTT brokers and publish/subscribe to MQTT topics.

#### 2. [mqtt-packet](https://github.com/mqttjs/mqtt-packet)

`mqtt-packet` is a low-level library for encoding and decoding MQTT packets. It serves as the core protocol implementation for MQTT.js and can be used independently in other MQTT-related projects.
